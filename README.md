<hr>

## I was given a task by a client to build the Front-end of a React app with three main pages:

-  Phones Page - This page will enable the user to add/remove phones that will send the invite links(zombies)üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

-  Groups Page - This page will enable the user to add/edit/remove groups that the app will scrape from.

-  Activate Page - This page will enable the user to config his settings and activate the bot.



## Prerequisites
* BackEnd server configured with the keys needed for the shoes in the app: ```{imgUrl, description, price}```
* Set up the api.js to have the right api to access your own Database
* Small cup of coffee üòâ‚òï

In order to run the app locally you will need to install all the dependencies from the package.json file.  
Run the command ``` npm install ``` to install all the dependencies, after it's done you can run ``` npm start``` to start the app locally in ```localhost:3000```


<br>


# Summary
By going through all the steps and making sure you have the prerequisites you:
- Deployed the shoes store Admins panel app locally with all the dependencies needed.
- Can Edit/Delete/Add shoes on you Admins panel app.
